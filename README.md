**TO RUN THE SVELTE PROJECT**

Needs spa-router
`npm install svelte-spa-router`
Needs iconify@svelte 
`npm install @iconify/svelte`

**RESOLUTION**

This app works best on width resolution greater than 500px and height resolution greater than 900px, so 500x900 to 700x1200 to 900x1600 (might be too large).
However, it is reasonably responsive for smaller or larger resolutions, especially for mobile (tested on iphone)
